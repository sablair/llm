# Local RAG creation

My attempt at learning RAGs using foundational models. This example takes a PDF, gives it to my local or OpenAI model so that
I can ask questions about the PDF.

## Setup

1. Run the commands below to set up a virtual environment.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY = [ENTER YOUR OPENAI API KEY HERE]
```
